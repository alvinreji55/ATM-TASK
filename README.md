### Overview of the Project:

##Project: Python Development


### Project: Create An ATM Machine Simulation

###Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation using Python. The simulation replicates essential ATM functionalities such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, PIN change, and transaction history review. This project enhances the understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and demonstrates the application of core Python principles in a real-world scenario.

###Key Activities:
- ** 1. Account Creation and Authentication:
 Develop user account profiles with account number, PIN, and balance details.
Implement PIN-based authentication for secure access to ATM functionalities.
- ** 2. Balance Inquiry:
Display the current account balance when requested by the user.
- ** 3. Cash Withdrawal:
Allow users to withdraw cash if there are sufficient funds in their account.
Deduct the requested amount from the account balance and show the updated balance.
- ** 4. Cash Deposit:
Enable users to deposit cash into their accounts.
Add the deposited amount to the balance and display the updated account status.
- ** 5. PIN Change:
Provide users with the option to change their PIN after verifying the current one.
- ** 6. Transaction History:
Track and display a list of all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, balance checks) made by the user.
- ** 7. Error Handling:
Ensure appropriate error messages and handling for situations like insufficient funds, incorrect PIN entry, or invalid operations.
- ** 8. Exit:
Provide a way to safely exit the ATM simulation after completing all operations.

###  Technologies Used:
- ** 1 Python: The entire ATM simulation is implemented using Python, leveraging its built-in libraries for input handling, time delay, and file operations.

- ** 2 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): Classes are used to represent the ATM machine and account functionalities. Encapsulation is applied to protect user data, while methods control account transactions.

- ** 3 File Handling: Transaction history and account data are logged and stored using Pythonâ€™s file handling mechanisms, simulating data persistence and logging.

- ** 4 Error and Exception Handling: Proper exception handling ensures the program can deal with common issues such as invalid input, insufficient funds, and incorrect PIN entries, offering a smooth user experience.
